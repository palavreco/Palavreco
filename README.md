# Palavreco
Palavreco is a simple Portuguese Discord bot that simulates a [**Wordle**](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game in-app.
It's very simple to play, just use the command **`/adivinhar`** and have fun! If you have any questions about the game, use the command **`/ajuda`**, that will give you some information about the game.
